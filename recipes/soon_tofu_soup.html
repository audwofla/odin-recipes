        <h2>What is this dish?</h2>
        <p>Soon tofu soup is a spicy, savory Korean stew made with tofu, broth, and red pepper oil. 
            I would eat this whenever we would go to the local restaurant.  Some common ingredients 
            are enoki mushrooms, kimchi, onions, assorted mushrooms, egg, seafood, and beef.
        </p>
        <p>The recipe we are preparing today is one that I worked on with my girlfriend.
            Because I am vegan, we will be ommiting the meat, seafood, and egg.  Let's go
            on this adventure to eat this spicy, savory dish!
